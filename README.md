Application for monitoring university rankings in the fields of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) and Electrical & Electronic Engineering (EEE) according to the Shanghai Ranking system algorithm. The application solves the problem of the unavailability of ranking data for lower-ranked uni- versities and offers monitoring of the ranking assessment for the current year before the official Shanghai Ranking ranking list is out. It offers the user a tabular view of the estimated ranking along with the values of the indicators used to calculate the ranking, graphical representation of changes in the ranking data of the selected uni- versity, comparison of the ranking assessment with the Shanghai Ranking data, and database search by university name. The main technologies used to create the applica- tion are: React, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Puppeteer and Docker.
